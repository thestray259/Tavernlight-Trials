Q1 - Fix or improve the implementaion of the below methods
-- if I'm being completely honest, I'm not too sure how this one is supposed to work
local function releaseStorage(player)
player:setStorageValue(1000, -1)
end

function onLogout(player)
if player:getStorageValue(1000) == 1 then
addEvent(releaseStorage(player), 1000, player) -- the method call was missing the parameter, though I'm not sure if 'player' is what should go there
end
return true
end



Q2 - Fix or improve the implementation of the below method
-- it seems wrong that memberCount is only used for resultId
function printSmallGuildNames(memberCount)
-- this method is supposed to print names of all guilds that have less than memberCount max members
local selectGuildQuery = "SELECT name FROM guilds WHERE max_members < %d;"
local resultId = db.storeQuery(string.format(selectGuildQuery, memberCount))
local guildName = resultId.getString("name") -- 'result' isn't defined, maybe it should be resultId?
print(guildName)
end



Q3 - Fix or improve the name and the implementation of the below method
-- method appears to remove a member from the player's party so I renamed it to that, also changed it to be camelCase to be consistent with the rest
function removeMemberFromPlayerParty(playerId, membername) 
player = Player(playerId)
local party = player:getParty()

for k,v in pairs(party:getMembers()) 
do -- when looking at Lua documentation, it shows that in for loops, 'do' is on the next line instead of the same line
if v == Player(membername) then
party:removeMember(v) -- if v is the same as Player(membername), then why not do party:removeMember(v) instead?
end
end
end
